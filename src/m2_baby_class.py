# TODO: 2.  In this module you will implement and test a   Baby  class.
#           Here is an OVERVIEW of the steps you will take to do so.
#  _
#    Step 2 (this step): Read this overview of this module.
#    Step 3: Read and understand the SPECIFICATION for the  Baby  class.
#    Step 4: Read and understand the TESTS for the  Baby  class.
#              We supplied those tests.
#    Step 5: IMPLEMENT and TEST the Baby class.
#  _
#  Once you understand this OVERVIEW, mark this _TODO_ as DONE.

# TODO: 3. SPECIFICATION (read the following):
#   Here (below) are the methods that you must implement in your Baby class:
#  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  _
#   Constructor method (that is, the   __init__  method):
#      What comes in:
#         -- self
#         -- a string for the name of the Baby
#      What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#      Side effects:
#         -- Prints "Hello baby <your baby's name>!"
#         -- Sets instance variables as needed
#              [YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IS NEEDED AS YOU IMPLEMENT THE METHODS!]
#      Example:
#          b = Baby("McKinley")
#      causes the following to be printed on the Console:
#          Hello baby McKinley!
#  _
#   feed_baby:
#      What comes in:
#         -- self
#      What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#      Side effects:
#         -- Prints "Thank you for feeding baby <your baby's name>."
#         -- Modifies instance variables as needed.
#      Example:
#          b = Baby("Joshua")
#          b.feed_baby()
#      causes the following to be printed on the Console:
#          Hello baby Joshua!
#          Thank you for feeding baby Joshua.
#  _
#   hour_passes
#      What comes in:
#         -- self
#      What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#      Side effects:
#       -- If this is the FIRST time this method has been called
#          since this Baby was created or last fed, then this method prints:
# 	         "Baby <your baby's name> is sleeping."
#  _
#       -- If this is the SECOND time this method has been called
#          since baby was created or last fed, then this method prints:
# 	         "Baby <your baby's name> is awake.  Time for food."
#  _
#       -- If this is the THIRD (OR MORE) time this method has been called
#          since baby was created or last fed, then this method prints:
#            "Baby <your baby's name> is CRYING uncontrollably!  Feed the Baby!"
#  _
#       -- Modifies instance variables as needed.
#  _
#      Examples:  See the two TEST functions below.
#  _
#  You may find it helpful to read the two TEST functions (below) at this time.
#  If reading the TEST functions below does not make this specification clear,
#     ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED to clarify this specification.
#  _
#  Once you understand this SPECIFICATION, mark this _TODO_ as DONE.

###############################################################################
# TODO: 4. TESTS (read the following):
#  The two functions that follow this comment TEST the Baby class.
#  For each of those two functions:
#    1. READ the CODE in the function.
#         As you do so, PREDICT what the code will cause to be printed.
#    2. READ the doc-string for the function.
#         It shows the CORRECT output when the function runs.
#    3. CONFIRM that you understand WHY the function's CODE produces
#         the OUTPUT that the doc-string says that it will.
#  _
#     If you do not understand why the CODE produces the OUTPUT as written
#     in the function's doc-string, STOP HERE and ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED.
#     Do  ** NOT **  attempt to write the  Baby  class
#     without fully understanding both of its test functions.
#  _
#  Once you fully understand the TESTS below, mark this _TODO_ as DONE.
