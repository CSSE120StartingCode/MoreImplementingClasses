# TODO: 2. Implement a class called   Baby   that has a constructor and
#   two methods, as described below.  Your finished Baby class should
#   cause the code above to display the expected output.  Hint: Your
#   class will need instance variables that you must figure out.
#
# Constructor
#     What comes in:
#        -- self
#        -- a string for the name of the baby
#     What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#     Side effects:
#        -- Sets instance variables as needed
#        -- Prints 'Hello baby <your baby's name>!'
#
# feed_baby
#     What comes in:
#        -- self
#     What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#     Side effects:
#        -- Prints 'Thank you for feeding baby <your baby's name>.'
#        -- Modifies instance variables if needed
#
# hour_passes
#     What comes in:
#        -- self
#     What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
#     Side effects:
#      -- If it is the first time this function has been called since Baby was created or fed
# 	       -- Prints 'Baby <your baby's name> is sleeping.'
#      -- If it is the second time this function has been called since baby was created or fed
# 	       -- Prints 'Baby <your baby's name> is awake.  Time for food.'
#      -- If it is the third (or more) time this function has been called since baby was created or fed
# 	       -- Prints 'Baby <your baby's name> is CRYING uncontrollably!  Feed the Baby!'
#
# After implementing this class run this module and compare your output
#   to the expected output of main.
#
# Notice that the baby is never printed, so you are not required to make
#     a __repr__ method.  Each method call above simply does a print as
#     a side effect.
